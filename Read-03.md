HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.The main parts of our element are as follows:

* The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
* The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
* The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
