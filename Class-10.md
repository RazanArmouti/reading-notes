# Read: 10 - JS Debugging

## ***JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY***

 **API**
  * APls are used in browsers, scripts, and by websites that share functionality with other programs or sites.
  * APls let you write code that will make a request,asking another program or script to do something.
  * APls also specify the format in which the response will be given (so that the response can be understood).
  * To use an API on your website, you will need to include a script in the relevant web pages.
  * An APl's documentation will usually feature tables of objects, methods, and properties.
  * Providing you know how to create an object and call its methods, access its properties, and respond to its events, you should be able to learn any JavaScript API

  **Error Handling & Debugging**
   * If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error
in your code.
   * Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
   * The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
   * JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
   * If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
   * Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
