images on several pages of your site.
  * Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
  * You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
  * Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

  * To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

and what they do when they get there.

  * FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.

## ***Video and Audio APIs***
