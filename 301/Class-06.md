# Readings: NODE.JS
## ***An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com***
**1. What is node.js?**  
 Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
 Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

**2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**  
 It is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

**3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?** 
 This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

**4. What is npm?**
 a package manager that comes bundled with Node.

**5. What version of node are you running on your machine?**

## ***6 Reasons for Pair Programming***
**1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

 2. Engaged collaboration
 3. Learning from fellow students
 4. Social skills
 5. Job interview readiness
 6. Work environment readiness

**2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?** 
 The Greater efficiency

**3. How does pair programming work?**
 While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
