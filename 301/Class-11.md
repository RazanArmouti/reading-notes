# Readings: Mongo and Mongoose
## ***nosql vs sql***
**1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**  
| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SQL databases are table basesd where we can store the data in tables.each table contains numbers of rows       | NoSQL databases are document based where we can store the datd as key value pairs       |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable which means if we need to increase the performance we can upgrade the server hardware(CPU,RAM,etc...)   | NoSQL databases are horzentally scalable which means if we need to increase the performance we can increase the numbers of servers        |
| SQL databases have predefined schema      | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema       |
| Excellent support is available from vendors of SQL databases    | where as in NoSQL databases developers should depend on community support        |
| In SQL databases there is a relations between tables      | In NoSQl there is not a relation concept at all because the data is stored as unstructured data       |

**2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?** 
 If the data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined.

**3. Give a real world example.** 
 Developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records.

**4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
 hierarchical data

**5. Give a real world example.** 
 data from social media analysis and websites

**6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
 NoSQL databases.

**7. Which type of database is best for scalability?** 
 SQL databases.

## ***sql vs nosql (Video)***
**1. What does SQL stand for?** 
 Structured Query Language
**2. What is a realational database?** 
 A relational database is a collection of data items (tables) that has a predefined relationship between them
**3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?** 
 a relational database work with tables structure
**4. What is a ‘schema’?**
 Schema is predefined structure to normalize how the data should be added to the table. in SQL it should be follow a standard schema for each table.
**5. What is a NoSQL database?** 
 NoSQL database is a database type where there is no relations between groups of data.
**6. Howo does it work?** 
 NoSQL databases do not rely on relational structures and use more flexible data models l(collections and documents)
**7. What is inside of a Mongo database?** 
 There are collections inside Mongo database and inside each collection there are documents (objects) to represent the data
**8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**
 NoSQL is more flexible because it dose not adhere to a predefined schema
**9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**
 one of the most disadvantage of NoSQL is you need to update documents in multiple places if the user update one in one place
