An illustration of the Growth Mindset framework

I think it’s my inability to use – and stay in – a growth mindset that keeps me from heading home smiling more often. If we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.

**Dealing with the following list correctly of Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset:**

* Challenges
* Obstacles
* Effort
* Criticism
* Success of others

Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective. A growth mindset opens Us up to more creativity and possibility

**There's three things I use it to remind myself of how to keep it in a growth mindset**
1. What was the best part of the day?
2. What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?
3. Which aspects of my work am I most proud of?
