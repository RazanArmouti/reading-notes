# Git
*Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.*

**The benefits of using Git :**
* Snapshots
* Local Operations
* Tracking Changes
* Minimize the possibility of Loss of Data
* Snapshots

**The local Git repository has three components:**

1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
2. Index: The area used for staging
3. Head: Points to the most recent commit

**Impotant command we will use it via Git to deal with files:**

+ git add .
+ git commit -m "your notes"
+ git pull origin main
+ git push origin main
