# Design web pages with CSS
**CSS**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages.CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:**
+ External CSS
+ Internal CSS
+ Inline CSS

**CSS reference**
Use this CSS reference to browse an alphabetical index of all of the standard CSS properties, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, data types, functional notations and at-rules. You can also browse key CSS concepts and a list of selectors organized by type. Also included is a brief DOM-CSS / CSSOM reference.

*The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. The general reasoning behind this was discussed in a May 2007 post, if you're interested. Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks, and the original "meyerweb reset" found its way into Blueprint, among others.*
