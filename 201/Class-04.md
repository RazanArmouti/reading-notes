# Read: 04 - HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions
## ***HTML & CSS***

**1. Links**

* types of links:

  * Links from one website to another
  * Links from one page to another on the same website
  * Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
  * Links that open in a new browser window
  * Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone

* If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening a tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
* Links are created using the a element.
* The a element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

**2. Layout**
* div elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## ***JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY***

**1. Functions, Methods, and Objects**
* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.
* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value.
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## ***6 Reasons for Pair Programming***
* Four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful
* Agile practice: 
  1. Greater efficiency
  2. Engaged collaboration
  3. Learning from fellow students
  4. Social skills
  5. Job interview readiness
  6. Work environment readiness
