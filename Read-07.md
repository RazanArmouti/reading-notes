# Programming with JavaScript
**1. Expressions and operators: **
+ Assignment operators
+ Comparison operators
+ Arithmetic operators
+ Bitwise operators
+ Logical operators
+ String operators
+ Conditional (ternary) operator
+ Comma operator
+ Unary operators
+ Relational operators

**2.Functions**
+ Function declarations:

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

  * The name of the function.
  * A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
  * The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:

function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

+ Function expressions

a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:

const square = function(number) { return number * number }

var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16

*Function scope:*
Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

*Closures:*
Closures are one of the most powerful features of JavaScript. JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other variables and functions that the outer function has access to).

**3. Control flow** 
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
