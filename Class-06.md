# Read: 06 - JS Object Literals; The DOM
## ***Understanding The Problem Domain ***
You should able to learn that problem domain and because of it, Then you will able to write the code very easily as well.

## ***JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY***
**1. Object Literals**
  * When call the function, the function arguments either varaiables or values.
  * Functions can return more than one value using an array.
  * llFEs are commonly used as a wrapper around aset of code.
  * variable's scope: Local, Global.


**2. Document Object Model**
  * There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
  * The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
  * DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
  * You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
  * Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
  * From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
  * An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
  * In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
  * Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
