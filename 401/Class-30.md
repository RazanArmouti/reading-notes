## JSX
`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`
This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.


It helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

## Rendering Elements
`React element is the smallest renderable unit available in React. `

 Rendering an Element in React: In order to render any element into the Browser DOM, we need to have a container or root DOM element. It is almost a convention to have a div element with the id=”root” or id=”app” to be used as the root DOM element

 ## Components and Props

 **function components** :This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

 **Props** :  is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes

 **state** : is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component's current situation.It's managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function)

## Handling Events
he React onClick event handler enables you to call a function and trigger an action when a user clicks an element, such as a button, in your app
