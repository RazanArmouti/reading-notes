# Dynamic Routes

Next.js enables you to define dynamic routes in your app using the brackets `([param])`. Instead of setting a static name on your pages, you can use a dynamic one.

## How to link between pages

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page to make your app fast and user-friendly. It uses the `Link` component provided by `next/link` to enable transitions between routes

## Deploying Your Next.js App

The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the `Vercel` platform from the creators of Next.js. `Vercel` is a cloud platform for static sites, hybrid apps, and Serverless Functions.

1. Sign up to `Vercel` (no credit card is required).
2. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).
3. Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work fine!
4. After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.
