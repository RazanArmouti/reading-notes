# Dunder Methods

a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example

- **Object Initialization: __init__**
- **Object Representation: __str__, __repr__**
- **Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__**
- **Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__**
- **Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__**
- **Callable Python Objects: __call__**
- **Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__**

## Python Iterators :

is an object that contains a countable number of elements that can be iterated upon. In simpler words, we can say that Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse through all the elements of a collection and return one element at a time
## Python Generators :

is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a yield statement is used rather than a return statement
