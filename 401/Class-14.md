# Readings: Data Visualization
## ***Matplotlib Tutorial*** 
 matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.
 IPython: IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

 pyplot:pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

## ***Bokeh Tutorial*** 
 Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It is good for:
 1. Interactive visualization in modern browsers
 2. Standalone HTML documents, or server-backed apps
 3. Expressive and versatile graphics
 4. Large, dynamic or streaming data
 5. Easy usage from python (or Scala, or R, or...)

 Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
