## ***Python Scope***
 The concept of scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code. It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the LEGB rule.

 The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in scopes. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.

## ***Don’t be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!***
 Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

 1. O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
 2. O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. 
 3. O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. 
 4. O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.
