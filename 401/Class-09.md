## ***Statistics - Probability*** 
    When studying statistics for data science, you will inevitably have to learn about probability. It is easy lose yourself in the formulas and theory behind probability, but it has essential uses in both working and daily life. We’ve previously discussed some basic concepts in descriptive statistics; now we’ll explore how statistics relates to probability.
    Prerequisites:
    Similar to the previous post, this article assumes no prior knowledge of statistics, but does require at least a general knowledge of Python and general data science worflows. If you are uncomfortable with for loops and lists, I recommend covering them briefly in our free introductory Python course before progressing.

    What is probability?
    At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

    1. Flipping a heads
    2. Flipping a tails

    These two events form the sample space, the set of all possible events that can happen. To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur (say flipping heads) and dividing it by the sample space. Thus, probability will tell us that an ideal coin will have a 1-in-2 chance of being heads or tails. By looking at the events that can occur, probability gives us a framework for making predictions about how often events will happen. However, even though it seems obvious, if we actually try to toss some coins, we’re likely to get an abnormally high or low counts of heads every once in a while. If we don’t want to make the assumption that the coin is fair, what can we do? We can gather data! We can use statistics to calculate probabilities based on observations from the real world and check how it compares to the ideal.

## ***Intro to Statistics*** 
 Statistics is crucial to Data Science! In fact, the phrase Data Science was first used in a Statistics conference title. In this video,theyed covered 3 key concepts from Statistics that every Data Scientist needs to know. Statistical features, probability distributions, and Bayesian statistics will be explained using code, theory, and animations
