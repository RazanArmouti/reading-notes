 Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics, particularly if you came to Python because you were searching for something more powerful than Excel and VBA. Pandas uses fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.
 Pandas is a core package with additional features from a variety of other packages. And thatâ€™s great because you can work only using pandas.
 pandas is like Excel in Python: it uses tables (namely DataFrame) and operates transformations on the data. But it can do a lot more.
