## Google and AI

I don't agree with this and what I understand from that google employees are angry that the company is making a censored search engine
Google is experiencing a “moral and ethical” crisis. That’s the view of hundreds of employees at the tech company, who are protesting the development of a censored search engine for internet users in China.
The internal backlash among employees represents mounting concerns about whether Google has “lost its moral compass” in the corporate pursuit to enrich shareholders. But it also suggests that the people who make Google’s technology have more power in shaping corporate decisions than even shareholders have.

## Big Data is our Civil Rights issue

I agree with this and what I understand from that Big Data isn’t the volume of information. It turns out Big Data doesn’t have to be all that big. Rather, it’s about a reconsideration of the fundamental economics of analyzing data.
In the old, data-is-scarce model, companies had to decide what to collect first, and then collect it. A traditional enterprise data warehouse might have tracked sales of widgets by color, region, and size. This act of deciding what to store and how to store it is called designing the schema, and in many ways, it’s the moment where someone decides what the data is about. It’s the instant of context.
