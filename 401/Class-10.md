# Implementation: Stacks and Queues
## ***Stacks and Queues***
 A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
 Common terminology for a stack is
 1. Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
 2. Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 3. Top - This is the top of the stack.
 4. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
 5. IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

 What is a Queue
 Common terminology for a queue is 
 1. Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
 2. Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
 3. Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
 4. Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
 5. Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
 6. IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
