# Readings: Linear Regressions

## ***How to Run Linear Regression in Python*** 
 You can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn. Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
 Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
 1. lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
 2. lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
 3. lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
 You can also explore the functions inside lm object by pressing lm./tab

## ***Linear Regression in Python***
 Linear regression is one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. Whether you want to do statistics, machine learning, or scientific computing, there are good chances that you’ll need it. It’s advisable to learn it first and then proceed towards more complex methods.
 Types of Linear Regression:
  1. Problem Formulation
  2. Regression Performance
  3. Simple Linear Regression
  4. Multiple Linear Regression
  5. Polynomial Regression
  6. Underfitting and Overfitting

## ***Train & Test Splits*** 
 In statistics and machine learning we usually split our data into two subsets: training data and testing data (and sometimes to three: train, validate and test), and fit our model on the train data, in order to make predictions on the test data. When we do that, one of two thing might happen: we overfit our model or we underfit our model. We don’t want any of these things to happen, because they affect the predictability of our model — we might be using a model that has lower accuracy and/or is ungeneralized (meaning you can’t generalize your predictions on other data).

## ***What is Linear Regression*** 
 Types of Linear Regression:
  1. Simple linear regression
  2. Multiple linear regression
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Ordinal regression
